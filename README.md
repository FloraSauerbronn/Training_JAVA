# Training_JAVA
I did some tests and exercises using JAVA, I found the language interesting, but my favorite will always be Python.

I took a JAVA test for a very interesting selection process, where I learned a lot. All scripts used in the process are found here, the problems vary between the use of conditionals, the use of Booleans, the definition of variables and inputs that interact with the user.
